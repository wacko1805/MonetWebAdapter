# Use Material You Dynamic Wallpaper Colours on your Website!

## How it works for you:
- You simply install the app, and view supported websites in Material You dynamic colouring!

## How it works for web developers:
- It is as simple as adding a JavaScript File, and reconfiguring your exsisting colour variables to a new format

## How does the app work?
The app broadcasts all the avalible material 3 dynamic colours from localhost on the device, in a JSON format. If the script is implemented on a site, the site will be searching for the localhost:8192 service, and if it is not avelible, will default to the pre defined colours of the site. 

## Implemention.
- All you need is two files, the script file, and a colours.json file that contains the default colours for your website.
- Refer to the material 3 design guidlines for accesability, as the colours are dynamic!
